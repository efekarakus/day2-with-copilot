# Customizing your domain name

In [Step 1: 01-getting-started](https://github.com/efekarakus/day2-with-copilot/tree/01-getting-started), we created an ECS service on AWS Fargate behind an application load balancer. The default HTTPS endpoint generated by Copilot was: https://frontend.test-ohio.coffeeshop.efecoffeeshop.com.  
The default endpoints follow the pattern: `https://<svc>.<env>.<app>.domain.com`.   
While this might be okay for a test environment, in production we want to take control over the 
generated DNS name. 

### Step 1: Use the `http.alias` field to specify a DNS name
Update the `copilot/frontend/manifest.yml` file with an alias field to specify a dns name.
```yaml
http:
  alias: 'api.efecoffeeshop.com'
```

### Step 2: Deploy your service
Run `copilot deploy`.

That's it! Copilot will on your behalf:
1. Request and validate and ACM certificate for your domain, with the following additional names:
  * `*.domain.com`
  * `app.domain.com`
  * `*.app.domain.com`
  * `*.env.app.domain.com`
2. Add an A-record to the domain hosted zone to point to your application load balancer.

Note that with Copilot, your domain can live in a complete different account and region than your environment and Copilot will handle cross account provisioning for you!
